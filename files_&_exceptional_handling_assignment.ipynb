        "\n",
        "Answer. Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line using an interpreter, making them flexible and easy to debug but generally slower in execution. Python, JavaScript, and Ruby are examples of interpreted languages. In contrast, compiled languages, such as C and Java, translate the entire source code into machine code before execution, resulting in faster performance but requiring a compilation step. Python is considered an interpreted language because it does not require explicit compilation, making development faster. However, Python can also be compiled to bytecode, which is executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM) for improved performance."

        "\n",
        "Answer. Exception handling in Python allows a program to handle runtime errors gracefully, preventing abrupt crashes. It is implemented using the try-except block, where the try block contains code that might raise an exception, and the except block catches and handles the error. Python also supports finally, which executes code regardless of whether an exception occurs, and else, which runs only if no exception is raised. Exception handling is crucial for making programs robust and error-resistant, ensuring they function smoothly under unexpected conditions such as invalid user input or file access errors."

It ensures that important finalization tasks are completed even if an error is raised. For example, if a program opens a file for reading, the finally block can ensure the file is closed, preventing resource leaks. This is particularly useful when dealing with network connections, database transactions, or file operations, where proper resource management is crucial. Even if an exception is not handled, the finally block still executes before the program terminates."

        "\n",
        "Answer. Logging is a built-in Python module that allows developers to record program execution details, such as error messages, warnings, and debugging information. It is useful for tracking application behavior and troubleshooting issues. The logging module provides different severity levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL, which help categorize log messages. Unlike print(), logging can write messages to files, format output, and handle logging in complex applications. Developers use logging to monitor software performance, detect bugs, and store execution history for auditing purposes, making it an essential tool for production environments."

        "Answer. The __del__ method in Python is a destructor that is automatically called when an object is about to be deleted. It allows developers to define custom cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing network connections. However, Python’s garbage collector manages memory efficiently, so explicit use of __del__ is rare. Improper use of __del__ can lead to circular reference issues, where objects cannot be deleted due to mutual references. While __del__ provides control over object destruction, developers should prefer context managers (with statements) for resource management, ensuring proper cleanup without relying on explicit destructors."

In contrast, from module import function imports specific functions, allowing direct use without prefixing. The latter improves readability but risks namespace conflicts. Using import module is recommended for large projects to maintain clear module separation, whereas from module import is useful for frequently used functions to improve code brevity. The from module import * statement is generally discouraged as it can lead to unexpected conflicts and reduce code clarity."
